# BetFree Brand Style Guide

## Overview

The BetFree brand embodies a balance of strength and clarity, designed to support individuals on their journey away from gambling addiction. Our text-based logo visualizes the concept of breaking free from gambling through typography, using a strikethrough on "Bet" and highlighting "Free" to emphasize our mission.

## Logo

### Primary Mark: BetFree Text Logo

Our primary logo is the "BetFree" text logo - featuring the word "Bet" with a strikethrough line and "Free" in our vibrant teal color. This design directly communicates the app's purpose: freedom from betting and gambling addiction. The logo is set against a circular dark background with a partial teal accent that suggests movement and breaking free.

**Logo Variations:**

1. **Full Logo** - Text logo with "Bet" (strikethrough) and "Free" (teal) in circular container
   - Use for: Welcome screens, about pages, marketing materials
   - Minimum size: 40px height

2. **Compact Logo** - Simplified text mark
   - Use for: App icon, small spaces, favicon
   - Minimum size: 24px height

3. **Horizontal Logo** - Text logo with optional brand name to the right
   - Use for: Navigation bars, headers, letterheads
   - Minimum size: 30px height

### Clear Space

Maintain clear space around the logo equal to at least 20% of its total height. This ensures the logo remains visually distinct and impactful.

### Don'ts

- Do not stretch or distort the proportions
- Do not change the colors outside of the approved palette
- Do not rotate or flip the logo
- Do not add effects like drop shadows (beyond what's in the official files)
- Do not place the logo on visually cluttered backgrounds
