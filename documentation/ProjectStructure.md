# BetFreeApp Project Structure

## Correct File Paths

Based on testing, the following are the confirmed active file paths for key components:

### UI Components
- **Onboarding UI**: `BetFreeApp/BetFreeApp/BetFreeApp/BetFreeApp/EnhancedOnboardingView.swift`
  - This is the file controlling the main onboarding experience
  - Changes to colors and UI elements should be made here
  - ✅ UPDATED (March 2, 2024): Duplicate files have been removed

### Color and Style Files
- **BFColors**: `BetFreeApp/BetFreeApp/BetFreeApp/BetFreeApp/BFColors.swift`
  - Contains color definitions used throughout the app
  - Color scheme updates should be made here to maintain consistency
  - ✅ UPDATED (March 2, 2024): Duplicate files have been removed

## Project Structure Notes

The project has a nested directory structure. Previously, there were multiple copies of some files, but these duplicates have been removed.

Current directory structure:

```
BetFreeApp/
├── BetFreeApp/
│   ├── BetFreeApp/
│   │   ├── BetFreeApp/
│   │   │   ├── EnhancedOnboardingView.swift
│   │   │   ├── BFColors.swift
│   │   │   └── ...
│   │   └── ...
│   └── ...
└── ...
```

## Cleanup Actions

The following duplicate files were removed on March 2, 2024:
- `BetFreeApp/BetFreeApp/EnhancedOnboardingView.swift`
- `BetFreeApp/BetFreeApp/BFColors.swift`
- `BetFreeApp/Sources/BetFreeApp/BFColors.swift`

This cleanup ensures that developers will always be working with the correct files.

## Testing Methodology

To confirm the correct file path, we:
1. Modified both possible files with test colors (bright purple, hot pink, orange)
2. Built and ran the app
3. Observed which changes were reflected
4. Determined the 4-level nested path is the active one

## For Future Development

- When opening Xcode, ensure you're opening `BetFreeApp/BetFreeApp/BetFreeApp.xcodeproj`
- When building, use the correct path for `xcodebuild` commands
- Clear DerivedData when facing caching issues
- Avoid creating duplicate files in the project

## Color Scheme Implementation

When implementing the Serene Strength color scheme:
1. First update color definitions in `BFColors.swift`
2. Then ensure usage in `EnhancedOnboardingView.swift` and other UI files
3. Test changes by building and running on a simulator
