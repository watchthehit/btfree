## Recent Updates

### Bug Fixes (July 2023)

- Fixed type-checking issues in `EnhancedMotivationScreen.swift` by breaking complex expressions into smaller, more manageable components
- Resolved duplicate struct declarations for `FloatingShapes` by ensuring only one implementation exists
- Fixed ambiguous init() in `DashboardView.swift` by using fully qualified type paths
- Fixed property references in `EnhancedBreathingExerciseView.swift` and `EnhancedOnboardingView.swift` to properly use UserDefaults for missing properties
- Implemented proper animations in `ProfileView.swift` using ViewModifiers pattern

## Architecture

### Design Tokens

The app uses a comprehensive design token system defined in `BFDesignTokens.swift` that includes:

- Colors
- Typography
- Spacing
- Border Radius
- Shadows
- Animations

### App State Management

The app uses:
- `EnhancedAppState` as the main state container
- UserDefaults for persistence of user settings
- Environment Objects for state sharing across the view hierarchy

### Components

Key reusable components include:
- `FloatingShapes` - Visual background elements
- `ConfettiView` - Celebration animations
- Various card views and buttons with consistent styling

## Development

### Building the Project

```bash
cd /path/to/BetFreeApp
swift build
```

### Common Issues

- If experiencing type-checking timeout errors, break complex SwiftUI views into smaller components
- When adding new visual components, check for potential naming conflicts with existing views
