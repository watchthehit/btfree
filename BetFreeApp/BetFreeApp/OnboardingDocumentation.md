# Enhanced Onboarding Documentation

## Overview
The Enhanced Onboarding system provides a comprehensive, user-friendly introduction to the BetFree app. It guides users through setting up their profile, understanding the app's features, and customizing their experience.

## Components

### OnboardingViewModel

The `OnboardingViewModel` class manages all state and logic for the onboarding process:

- Tracks current page (0-7)
- Stores user inputs (name, goals, triggers, notification preferences)
- Provides methods for navigation and data manipulation
- Includes the `@MainActor` attribute to ensure UI updates happen on the main thread

Key methods:
- `nextPage()` / `previousPage()` - Handle navigation between screens
- `addTrigger()` / `removeTrigger()` - Manage user-selected triggers
- `saveToAppState()` - Transfers onboarding data to the app's persistent state

### EnhancedOnboardingView

This is the primary container view that:
- Manages the TabView for page switching
- Displays navigation controls (back/skip buttons)
- Shows progress indicators
- Hosts the individual content screens

### Individual Screen Views

Each onboarding step is implemented as a separate view:

1. **WelcomeScreen**: Introduction to the app's purpose
2. **NameInputScreen**: Collects the user's name
3. **GoalSettingScreen**: Sets daily mindfulness goal (in minutes)
4. **TriggerSelectionScreen**: Helps identify gambling triggers
5. **NotificationSetupScreen**: Configures notification preferences
6. **FeatureOverviewScreen**: Highlights key app features
7. **PrivacyScreen**: Explains privacy policies
8. **CompletionScreen**: Confirms setup and transitions to main app

## Flow Control

The onboarding process proceeds linearly but offers flexibility:
- Users can move forward with the "Continue" button
- Users can skip steps with the "Skip" button
- Users can go back to previous steps with the back button
- The final "Get Started" button completes onboarding and transitions to the main app
- Navigation to the main app occurs ONLY through explicit user action, never automatically

## Data Persistence

When onboarding completes:
1. All user preferences are transferred to the AppState
2. The `hasCompletedOnboarding` flag is set to true
3. Data is saved to UserDefaults for persistence across app launches

## UI Design Principles

The onboarding UI follows these key principles:
- Consistent visual language across all screens
- Clear, actionable headers and instructions
- Visual progress indicators (page dots)
- Accessibility considerations (readable text sizes, sufficient contrast)
- Responsive layout that works across device sizes

## Customization

The onboarding system can be easily extended:
- New screens can be added by creating a new view and adding it to the TabView
- The page count and indicators will automatically update
- Additional data collection can be added to the view model

## Testing

When testing the onboarding flow:
1. Verify that navigation works correctly in all directions
2. Confirm that user input is properly saved to AppState
3. Test that the "Skip" functionality properly bypasses screens
4. Ensure that returning users don't see the onboarding again
5. Verify that users are not unexpectedly taken to the main app during the flow

## Troubleshooting

### Premature Navigation
If users report being unexpectedly taken to the main app during onboarding:
- Check that there are no automatic timeouts or delayed callbacks in the onboarding flow
- Ensure the onboarding completion occurs only through explicit user actions
- Verify that `viewModel.saveToAppState()` is only called when intended

> **Important**: A previous issue where onboarding would automatically complete after 5 seconds has been fixed in the current version.
