### Changes Made

1. **EnhancedAppState Changes**
   - Added `isTabBarVisible` property to control tab bar visibility

2. **ProfileView Improvements**
   - Increased minimum content height to 1.5x screen height
   - Added extra spacers and padding at the bottom to ensure content is scrollable
   - Set proper UIScrollView properties (bounces and alwaysBounceVertical)
   - Called `refreshTabBarVisibility()` on appear to force recalculation

3. **MainTabView Updates**
   - Updated to use `isTabBarVisible` from EnhancedAppState instead of local state
   - Fixed padding and layout to ensure ProfileView has proper space for scrolling
   - Ensure proper tab bar z-indexing and animation

### Usage
No user action is required. These changes automatically improve scrolling behavior throughout the app, particularly in the Profile screen.
